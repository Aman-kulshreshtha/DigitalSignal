# DigitalSignal Analysis
It displays how we can plot a signal of given frequency and generate the corresponding square wave by adding terms of the fourier formula for square wave.

Plotting of NRZ-L and NRZ-I signal for given bit sequence is also done.
The effect of noise on the above two signals can also be visualised
